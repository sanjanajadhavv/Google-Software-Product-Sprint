            <p class="p1">
                My Name is Sanjana Jadhav and I am a student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Texas at
                Dallas.
                I am interested in Full-Stack Development and Artificial Intelligence. I have experience working with C,
                C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
                Currently, I am learning Python.
                I have also worked with frameworks such as React.js, React Native, and Node.js.
                In the past, I've collaborated on a back-end team to create a Stock-Picker app and also as a Full-Stack
                Developer to create an Android Application to adopt pets.
                I also worked on creating a device for autistic patients when they experience sensory overload.
                Outside of my academic life, I love to try new restaurants with my friends, taking pictures, and
                drinking Taro Milk Tea!
