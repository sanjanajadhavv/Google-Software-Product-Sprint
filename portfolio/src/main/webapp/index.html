          Hello Everyone! 
          My Name is Sanjana Jadhav and I am a student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas.
          I am interested in Full-Stack Development and Artificial Intelligence. I have experience working with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
          Currently, I am learning Python. 
          I have also worked with frameworks such as React.js, React Native, and Node.js.
          In the past, I've collaborated on a back-end team to create a Stock-Picker app and also as a Full-Stack Developer to create an Android Application to adopt pets.
          I also worked on creating a device for autistic patients when they experience sensory overload. 
          Outside of my academic life, I love to try new restaurants with my friends, taking pictures, and drinking Taro Milk Tea!
